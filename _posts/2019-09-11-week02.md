Licenses sound confusing, and I'm sure they are, but they don't come into play most of the time as far as I know. Though it's useful to know on the off-chance that some lawsuit or something comes up. It's also definitely useful to be aware of the resources available so that I can just use them whenever. 

In terms of suitable choices for a contribution, that's a complex question. I would love to contribute code, but it seems unlikely as a first contribution. It's more likely that I'd be able to correct a spelling or grammar error.

Hypothetically, I would love to contribute to Python, or some package, or my dream would be to contribute to Ubuntu, or even the Linux kernel.
