title: Week 4

On Thursday in class we all practiced collaborating on a git repository in groups of 4. Several conflicts (both merge conflicts and other types of conflicts), arose throughout the process.
On Monday we were taught a standard good git workflow. CLone from the remote repository. Create a remote fork. Make changes. Push them to your remote fork. Create a pull request from your fork to the upstream project. Merge the pull request upstream. Pull the upstream changes to your local clone. Rinse repeat.
I opened an issue on someone else's blog, and then just hit the edit button on GitHub, which created a fork of the repository under my username. Then once I made a commit, a branch was automatically created on my fork. I opened up a pull request from that branch on my fork to the original repository. I did not need to create a local copy on my machine at all. I also didn't need to worry about merge requests, as the project is very small comparatively.
