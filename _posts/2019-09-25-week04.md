title: Week 4

On Thursday in class we all practiced collaborating on a git repository in groups of 4. Several conflicts (both merge conflicts and other types of conflicts), arose throughout the process.
On Monday we were taught a standard good git workflow. CLone from the remote repository. Create a remote fork. Make changes. Push them to your remote fork. Create a pull request from your fork to the upstream project. Merge the pull request upstream. Pull the upstream changes to your local clone. Rinse repeat.
