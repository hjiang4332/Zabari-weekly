I thought that the article was pretty repetitive, though some parts were interesting. It kept stressing that open-source doesn't require technical know-how, which I think is obvious to those with technical know-how. But the term "open-source" doesn't really enter the lexicon of laypeople, and so it is an intimidating term. I wasn't sure about open-source business models, and after reading that article, it sounds pretty strange. In some ways, I don't like that. The RHEL model is not ideal. Charging people to be part of a community I feel like goes against open-source philosophy. And making parts of your code proprietary and selling them also seems to go against the philosophy. I think open-source developers should make money, and I may change the way I feel about the things I've said above, but there must be some better way to do this.
